"""Pipeline layer — the Director→Writer→Editor turn engine.

Each turn is handled by a chain of single-purpose modules:

* ``predicates`` — dependency-free helpers (the package's leaf, like ``core/``)
* ``state`` — per-turn dataclasses shared across all passes
* ``config`` — resolves flags, lanes, and the tool blob for a turn
* ``context`` — loads conversation data and builds LLM prefixes
* ``workflow_bridge`` — runs secondary-workflow hooks before and after the passes
* ``orchestrator`` — sequences the three passes and collects the result
* ``persistence`` — saves the assistant message and all turn side-effects
* ``entrypoints`` — the five public ``handle_*`` functions called by routes
* ``passes/`` — the director, writer, and editor passes
